Worth purchasing,5,I always purchased bata shoes they are comfortable cool and affordable. These deals in that price with that comfortable are amazing.
Shoe,5,"Ive been wearing Bata footwear for years, and they never cease to amaze me with their balance of comfort and durability. Whether its their formal collection or casual slip-ons, the build quality is solid enough to handle daily wear without falling apart. What I appreciate most is that they offer stylish designs without the 'designer' price tag. If you need reliable shoes that won't break the bank, Bata is always a safe bet."
Waste of money,1,"I purchased a black girls school shoe(size 3) from the Bata Mogappair East branch(opposite Spartan School) on 06 March 2025 for ₹;598.

As soon as I brought the shoe home, I noticed that the inner sole was coming off. I immediately went back to the store and requested an exchange, which they did.

However, within one month, the inner sponge started coming out and tearing from inside. Actually used the shoe for 7 months( that even with inside damages) The shoe became completely unusable now.

(Please note: April & May(2 months), schools were closed for summer vacation & Saturdays & Sundays are non-working days)

This means the shoe was actually used for less than 7 months with bad inner condition. Now outer parts also torn fully & can't wear them anymore.

Now, the condition of the shoe is very poor:

#One shoe is torn from the side and back

# Inner sponge is coming out

#Threads have come off

My child cannot wear it anymore

** I have uploaded photos as proof of the condition.

Finally, I had to buy a new pair from the Paragon brand, which costs almost half the price of the Bata shoe, yet the quality is much better.

This experience is very disappointing, especially from a brand like Bata, which is expected to provide durable school footwear."
A GOOD TO BUY SHOE,5,"Purchased a pair of Bata shoes a few months ago for daily use, mainly for walking and regular outdoor work. Bata is a well-known brand in India, so I expected decent quality and comfort, and overall my experience has been satisfactory.

The first thing I liked about these shoes is the comfort. The sole is soft and provides good grip, which makes walking easy even for long hours. The fitting is proper, and the shoes did not cause any foot pain even after wearing them for the whole day. The material quality also feels strong and suitable for Indian weather conditions.

Another good point is durability. I have been using these shoes regularly, and there is no major wear and tear till now. They are easy to clean and still look good after regular use. The design is simple and suitable for office as well as casual wear."
Shoe,5,"Very good. And light weight

generally considered a good value for everyday wear, offering affordable fashion with decent comfort, lightweight options, and good cushioning in some lines (like running shoes), but quality and durability are inconsistent; some find them long-lasting and soft (especially leather ones), while others report issues with material (hard leather, synthetic), sole breaking, and inconsistent sizing, making them a hit-or-miss depending on the specific model and user expectations for price"
Urgent: Incorrect and Unacceptable Product Deliver,1,"Dear Team,

I am extremely disappointed and shocked by the delivery I have just received from BATA. Instead of the sandals I ordered, I have been sent a completely different product and one that is clearly dirty and appears to be an old or used pair. This is entirely unacceptable from a brand of BATAs standing.

As a long-standing and loyal customer, I would like to bring to your attention that BATAs service standards have declined considerably over the past several months. With physical stores often poorly stocked and staff inadequately informed, customers like me are compelled to rely on online purchases, only to be met with experiences such as this.

To be very clear, I do not wish to receive a refund, as that would be the easiest resolution. I expect an immediate replacement of the exact same new pair of sandals originally ordered, delivered within the next 12 days, without any further inconvenience to me.

For your reference and verification, photographs of the product delivered are attached with this email.

I trust that this grievance will be taken seriously and resolved promptly to my complete satisfaction. I look forward to your immediate response and confirmation of the replacement dispatch.

Thank you.

Regards"

Comfortable and geniune product,5,"Bata selling all footwear is very good , power shoes very comfortable for running and geniune product."
Unhelpful Staff & No Sizes Available!,2,"I never visited any Bata store because I never liked its footwear, but yesterday I was passing through one store and I really liked the display articles, so I entered the showroom. It was a coincidence or any issue, whichever sandals I liked, they didn’t have my size in those sandals. Later, the staff lost interest in me and started attending to another customer, which usually doesn't happen whenever we go to any good showroom. They try their best to showcase different articles according to our taste to help us out. I never had such a bad experience ever, and this is the reason I won’t recommend anybody visit their showroom."

Best shoes for runners,4,"I have been using Bata running shoes for the last six months and found them perfect for daily running and jogging. The shoes offer excellent cushioning, good grip, and are lightweight, which helps in long-distance running. The sole is durable and flexible, allowing smooth movement on both roads and tracks. The breathable material keeps feet sweat-free, and the overall comfort is impressive for this price range. I recommend Bata running shoes to all beginners and regular runners looking for affordable quality."
Very good,3,Very comfortable shoes perfect for daily wear. Highly recommend Bata for both casual and formal options

Bad experience after 35 years consumer of Bata,1,Each & everyone in my family is the regular customer of Bata since 30+ years but recently we had a very bad experience by buying a slippers for my wife which bought in sep 2024 and in March 2025 found that the slipper turned in dual colour which I can not believe and acceptable and it’s not a cheap price it cost Rs 1400+ then as per store advise approached to customer service by mail with relevant bill and photographs.but only mail going up and down no solution very regret to say that as per them it has bought 6 months back Iam really tired with them . One thing wanted know from Bata authorities disclose whether the Bata product is only for six months instead of years life or they have to display in the store that the below price products are only these much life or they have to accept that their quality is declined. Then need not to step in to Bata stores in future.
Quality Has Dropped,2,"Bata used to be my go-to brand for reliable shoes, but my recent experience was really disappointing. I bought a pair of formal shoes, and within just a few weeks of normal use, the sole started to peel and the stitching came loose.

The comfort level wasn’t great either—hard sole and not ideal for long wear. I expected better durability, especially from a brand like Bata that’s known for quality.

Also, when I reached out to the store for a replacement, the service was slow and unhelpful. Unfortunately, it doesn’t feel like the same trusted brand anymore."

There is no recourse rather than to reach out to the customer who does not answer calls and has no intention of ever returning your product.

      "I ordered and paid for 8 pillows ( 4 packs of 2) of Goose feather and Down through Shopify from 4Btex. The pillows were supposed to be hotel grade. I received only half my order and the pillows are 3cm thick, substandard and not fit for purpose. I contacted Shopify who told me to contact 4Brex…I tried to contact the company on more than 20 occasions and have received neither the balance of the order or a full or partial refund. Shopify have told me to contact the company and at the moment 3 weeks in I am still going around in circles and am £111 down….DON’T USE this company to buy from..if you have a problem you’ve lost your money and have nobody to speak to to retrieve it for shoddy or undelivered goods!\n"
